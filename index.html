                    being fussed he still loves his own personal space when he gets sleepy. He enjoys playing with toys, empty plastic bottles but most of all playing with his little sister
                    Lunafreya.

                    Pekingese compared to her brother. Although smaller she still has a massive personality. She loves snuggles, beating up her brother, grunting when she wants something
                    and eating all the blueberries. Sadly Lunafreya has a medical condition known as a Liver shunt which means she can't eat normal foods like her brother, however this
                    doesn't stop her from enjoying the best things in life.
